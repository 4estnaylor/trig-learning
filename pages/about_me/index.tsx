      <AboutMeText>
        ‚ÄÉ For more than 7 years I have taught math, physics, and programming
        courses. Over the years, I have worked with hundreds of students in
        grades 6 - 12. For me and many others, math is best learned with lots of
        visuals, practice, questions, and pauses for thought . So, I try to
        incorporate a lot of that stuff into my teaching.
        <br />
        The math courses I have taught include:
        <CourseList>
          <li>pre-algebra</li>
          <li>algebra 1</li>
          <li>algebra 2</li>
          <li>geometry</li>
          <li>trigonometry &amp; precalculus</li>
          <li>probability &amp; statistics</li>
        </CourseList>
        Non-math courses include:
        <CourseList>
          <li>introduction to programming</li>
          <li>introduction to JavaScript</li>
          <li>animation with JavaScript</li>
          <li>physics</li>
          <li>english language</li>
        </CourseList>
        &emsp; I hold a bachelor‚Äôs degree in physics with minors in mathematics
        and rhetoric from Bates College. My thesis was a theoretical approach to
        understand advances in artificial leaf technology üçÉ .
